## Abstract

While the photospheric magnetic field of our Sun is routinely measured, its extent into the upper atmosphere remains elusive.
We present a novel approach for coronal magnetic field extrapolation, using a neural network that integrates observational data and the physical force-free magnetic field model. 
Our method flexibly finds a trade-off between the observation and force-free magnetic field assumption, improving the understanding of the connection between the observation and the underlying physics.
We utilize meta-learning concepts to simulate the evolution of active region NOAA 11158. Our simulation of 5 days of observations at full cadence, requires less than 13 hours of total computation time, enabling real-time force-free magnetic field extrapolations. 
A systematic comparison of the time evolution of free magnetic energy and magnetic helicity in the coronal volume, as well as comparison to EUV observations demonstrates the validity of our approach. The obtained temporal and spatial depletion of free magnetic energy unambiguously relates to the observed flare activity.
